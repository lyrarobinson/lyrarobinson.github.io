    <p>Lyra Robinson (b. 2002) is a transmedia artist whose work spans performance, installation, and video. </p>
	<p>Her practice is concerned with the mechanisms through which bodies are read, understood, and
		made legible in their interactions with datasets and surveillance technologies. She explores the
		possibilities for disrupting established knowledge systems to imagine new forms of embodied
		agency.</p>
	<p>Informed by Critical Posthumanism and Cyborg theory, Lyra investigates how corporeality, data, and
		visuality are entangled in contemporary visual infrastructures and platforms. Her work interrogates
		the multiplicities of power, sex, and sexuality that are enfolded into emergent human-machine
		ecologies.</p>	
	<p>She works primarily with ones and zeroes; manipulating experimental machine vision and deep
		learning processes to analyse the material and textural qualities of generative models built from
		mass data extraction, seeking to expose which parts of the models don't work, and what the data
		doesn't show.</p>	
	<p>Her primary mode of inquiry is through moving image, using new and unconventional media to
		position diagnostic practice as a liberating act of play. </p>	
	<p>She has recently exhibited at the Tate Modern and Photographer's Gallery in London, and
		internationally at CICA museum in Seoul. </p>
