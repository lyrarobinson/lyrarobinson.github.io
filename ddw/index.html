      <p>Alternative Operations uses real-time action classification to display a flood of training data taken from Moments in Time, corresponding to a viewer's action/inaction.</p>

      <p>Moments in Time is a collection of one million annotated 3 second videos, designed to correspond to the average duration of human short-term memory.</p>

      <p>Construction of the dataset was supervised by research scientists at MiT. Videos were primarily scraped from youtube, and categorised in several rounds by Amazon Mechanical Turk workers. </p>

      <p>The categories used in the final set are intentionally vague - 'opening' could refer to a door, a gate, or an eye. </p>

      <p>Overworked and underpaid Mechanical Turkers are required to decide whether a certain video fits into a vague category - categories that cross linguistic and cultural barriers. </p>

      <p>This taxonomy often fails, and in extreme cases, as Everest Pipkin pointed out, the categories 'kissing' and 'hitting' document unconsensual acts and excessive violence*. </p>

      <p>As well as a linguistic issue, the dataset also presents a technological one. The classifications in this piece are made by 2d resnet model, released by MiT to other researchers and pre-trained on the Moments in Time set. As you will notice - it is often inaccurate.</p>

      <p>The model will regularly default to categories with a higher internal visual consistency, and always seeks to recognise an action even when no action is performed. </p>

      <p><i>*These categrories have been removed from this installation. </i></p>
