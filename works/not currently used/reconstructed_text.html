	<p>Inspired by a scene from Italo Calvino's 'If on a winter's night a traveler' and Werner Herzog's 'ecstatic truth', this is a script that can remove articles and prepositions from the text
	in a pdf or epub file, then provide a list of the words and amount at which they occur, and then scale that list back up into the format of the original text.

		"What is the reading of a text, in fact, except the recording of certain thematic recurances, certain insistences of forms and meanings?"
